                    <li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">What is an FAQ Page?</li>
                    <li class="a">The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section is a part of your website where you address common concerns, questions or objections that customers have.

                        It’s different from your About Page where you tell the broader story behind your brand. The FAQ section, instead, deals with the specifics. It's the go-to destination for 
                        finding answers to specific questions about your product or business operation</li>

                    <li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">Where Do I Look For “Frequently Asked” Questions?</li>
                    <li class="a">Your inbox and customer support tickets will likely be the first place you should look.

                        But you should also anticipate objections that you can turn into questions, especially if the answer will put your customer’s mind at ease.

                        Consider how you can strategically raise the right questions to educate customers about your products and create demand.

                        When deciding how to choose the questions you’ll include in your FAQ section, focus on relevancy, utility and opportunities to turn that question into a path to further engagement or conversion.

                        If you end up with a long list of questions, group your questions under categories like “Shipping” or “About the Product” to make it easier for visitors to navigate.</li>

                    <li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">When Is an FAQ Page Appropriate?</li>
                    <li class="a">An FAQ page can be a distraction or an asset, depending on how you execute it.

                        But to ensure that it’s the latter, here are some things to consider when incorporating an FAQ page as part of your website:

                        Customers email you with the same questions on an ongoing basis, so it’s better to address them publicly and prominently.
                        You have or plan to create content/landing pages that you can link to and continue the journey from question to conversion.
                        Your product/service/business raises questions and concerns that are best handled in a straightforward manner.
                        That last point is especially important as an FAQ page presents a unique opportunity to directly address concerns and remove obstacles on the path to purchase.</li>

                    <li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">How Should I Answer My FAQs?</li>
                    <li class="a">How you position your answers is key here.

                        Even if the question is about a potential shortcoming in your product or business, try to frame the answer in a positive way.

                        While you should demonstrate authority through the depth of your answers, be sure you’re not losing your audience by giving them more than they need.

                        Write your questions from your customer's perspective (e.g. "How do I...") and answer from your business's perspective (e.g. "You should..." or "We provide...").

                        Focus on clear communication first and the goal you’re trying to achieve with each question of your FAQ. Are you addressing a concern about purchasing from you? Educating 
                        your audience about a part of your business model? Troubleshooting a common problem with your product? Focus on delivering that in your answer and move on.</li>

                    <li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">Can an FAQ Section Help With SEO?</li>
                    <li class="a">Many sites treat an FAQ section as a stand-alone page that uses a question and answer format to communicate information. While this serves the most basic function of 
                        an FAQ page—to reduce the friction on the path to purchase—you can also build an FAQ section with dedicated pages for each answer to create a more search-friendly section of your website.

                        By hyperlinking each question to a separate page, you can help surface each answer through Google and your own site’s search. Even if your audience isn't searching for topics related to your 
                        brand, they might be searching for answers to questions related to your industry via Google, which can help you get found if you create content or landing pages that are optimized for these specific search queries.</li>

                    <li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png">Where Should I Put My FAQ Section?</li>
                    <li class="a">It depends.

                        If customer service is a core part of your business, you might want to create a fully fleshed out support center or “help desk”, using Desk or Zendesk, with an FAQ incorporated as part of your customer support flow (i.e. customers check the FAQ before they reach out to a customer service rep).

                        But if you’re selling products or services that are bound to generate a lot of questions, it might be enough to prominently display a link to a simple FAQ page in your website navigation, like Death Wish Coffee does in the example above, to focus on reducing purchasing anxieties for visitors.

                        You can also consider integrating an FAQ directly into your product pages as part of your product descriptions, just like Vat19 does with all of their novelty products.</li>
